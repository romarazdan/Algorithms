# Algorithms
in C++ | CS 385

This is a course on more complex data structures, and algorithm design and analysis, using the C++ language. Topics
include: advanced and/or balanced search trees; hashing; further asymptotic complexity analysis; standard algorithm design
techniques; graph algorithms; complex sort algorithms; and other “classic” algorithms that serve as examples of design
techniques. Prerequisites: CS 135 and CS 284
